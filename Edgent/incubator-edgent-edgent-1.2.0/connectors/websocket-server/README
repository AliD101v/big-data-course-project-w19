This is an implementation of the JSR356 javax.websocket server implementation
based on Eclipse Jetty supplied jars.

The javax.websocket API uses the java.util.ServiceLoader to load a server
implementation.

To use this implementation, add the following to your classpath:
  connectors/javax.websocket-server/lib/javax.websocket-server.jar
  
As captured in the jar's manifest's classpath, the implementation dependents on
  connectors/javax.websocket-client/lib/javax.websocket-client.jar
