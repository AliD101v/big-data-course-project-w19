# Releasing Edgent

In general the `master` branch contains the repository state of the latest release of Edgent.
No commit should be done to `master` except for merging after a successful release.

Normal development is done in the `develop` branch or in feature branches that are merged to `develop` after they are finished.

A version is built up of three parts: `major`.`minor`.`bugfix`. For each major and minor version a corresponding `release` branch is maintained.
This allows shipping of bug-fix releases, if this is required. For bug-fix releases no new branch is created.

Assuming develop is currently in version `1.2.0-SNAPSHOT` and we are preparing a new release, then we would first create a `release/1.2` branch. Within this branch, the Edgent version is `1.2.0-SNAPSHOT` and develop becomes `1.3.0-SNAPSHOT`.
In the `release/1.2` branch all work prior to cutting a release or for fixing bug-fixes in an existing release can be performed. This branch is usually used to stabilize the software prior to a release.

As soon as the release branch is stable enough, the release manager cuts a release.

When doing this, all modules versions are set to a release version, this version is committed and tagged and then the version is usually incremented to the next higher bug-fix version.
So if the `release/1.2` branch is currently in version `1.2.0-SNAPSHOT`, the versions are changed to `1.2.0` and after the committing and tagging the version is updated to `1.2.1-SNAPSHOT`.

All of these steps are automated by the `maven-release-plugin`.

## Creating the release branch

A new release branch is always created from the `develop` branch. So make sure all changes have been pulled and the repo is up to date.

The following command performs the branching:

    mvn release:branch -P platform-android,platform-java7,distribution -DbranchName=release/1.2 -DautoVersionSubmodules=true

Without the `-DautoVersionSubmodules=true` we would have to specify the version for each module separately. This way we only have to specify the version of the root module and all children will inherit this version.

Also the only way all modules are processed, is if we enable the `distribution` and the two `platform-android` and `platform-java7` profiles.

After this the branches and the changes are committed, but not yet pushed. So as a last step here the release-manager needs to push the changes in his git repo.
